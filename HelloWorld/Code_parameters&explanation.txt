-->The below mentioned are the library inclusion format of C program;
We are using Liquid Crystal library for LCD, Software Serial library for
GSM and Sim900 inclusion and program accordingly, basically Hardware needs
to identify themselves in the IDE, so these library functions are necessary;
Also DHT library for DHT sensor.

#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include "DHT.h"


--> We are here defining which sensor is connected onto which pin of
Arduino UNO R3, like here M_sensor(M_sensor is a random variable name)
which is Moisture sensor is connected onto A5, of Arduino that is Analog pin 
5, DHTPIN(Variable name for DHT sensor) is on Digital PIN 8.
The term "#define DHTTYPE DHT11" specifies the type of DHT sensor used.

#define M_Sensor A5
#define DHTPIN 8
#define DHTTYPE DHT11


-->Here the Software Serial is the library or initalization function,
for specifying the ports onto which TX and RX of SIM900 are connected 
onto TX and Rx of Uno,for UART communication, so here it is TX and RX 
of Sim900 to 0(RX) and 
1(TX) of Uno are conncted along(note: 0&1 pin of Uno is PWM pins and 
are digital pins, also)
Liquid Crystal initalization and lcd is the variable,(similarly myserial
is als0 our own variable,forgot to mention)
so this line means "lcd(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)" Rx and Tx of LCd is connected to
2 and 3(both digital pins) of Uno and 4,5,6 & 7 means D4,D5,D6 & D7 of 
LCD to uno's 4,5,6&7 pins(all digital).
 
SoftwareSerial mySerial(1, 0);
LiquidCrystal lcd(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7);



--> These are variables connected to the pins mentioned after "=" sign
i.e fan as seen in circuit, basically relay is connected to 10, bulb's 
relay to 9 and heater's relay to 13(all digital pins)
 
int FAN = 10;
int relay = 9;
int bulb = 13;


-->Serial.begin(9600); this means serial communication begins betwe..
Uno and Arduino ide at baud rate(communication speed) of 9600
-->mySerial.begin(9600);this means serial communication begins betwe..
Uno and GSM(sim900D) at baud rate(communication speed) of 9600

lcd.begin(16, 2);LCD is started so that it can be programmed to operate
and (16,2) means 16 coloumns and 2 rows type LCD.
basically it can display 16*2 byte at a time.

  
--> all these below means, we are specifying how the pins, that these
components are connected to must act as, i.e either input or output
as we see all are outputs...
  pinMode(bulb,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(relay,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(FAN,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12,OUTPUT);



-->also Major diff between Void loop and setup is 
setup only to initalize the variables and set pinmode and serial comm
setup 
whereas the void loop block keeps executing until the uno is tunred off


Other commands gist-->
lcd.setCursor(2,1)
in this example the command sets the cursor of lcd screen at 2 coloumn
and 2nd row(note since counting stars from 0, 1 means 2nd row).


lcd.print();
prints any message in this block on LCD screen


digitalWrite();
sets the output of the digital pins
ex:digitalWrite(FAN, HIGH); upon condition of if loop being satisfied
this command if found in if loop block, for example,will set the output 
of variable FAN to whichever digital pin it is conncted to HIGH


delay(1000);
this command delays the program 
so 1000 here means 1 second, basically it counts time in milliseconds
therefore 1000ms=1 second.

all other commands are ought to be clear i suppose;
GSM communication works like this:
you must have noticed in Arduino IDE, whatever u print in Serial.println
command is show on the terminal, so the terminal outputs act as input 
for GSM module,
so to initate or set a GSM module to send SMS text the serial 
output console should print AT+CMGF=1;
which will initate the GSM module in text message sending mode,

i guess this example must make it clear what other commands mean in
GSM sensor module block in the code
